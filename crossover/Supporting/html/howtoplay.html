While playing against the computer, the player must choose a color other than the one selected by the computer.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Goal</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">The main agenda of this game is to collect the opponent&#8217;s coins. This can be achieved by moving your coins from one empty place to the other. The first player to capture all the coins wins the game.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Gameplay</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">There are 16 coins with each of the players (total number of coins is 32). All the coins are already placed on the board with the middle space vacant. Each player gets one turn to move the coin. The first player has to start by moving the coin to the vacant space. Once the game begins, the player can move their coin to the empty space or capture the opponent&#8217;s coin by jumping over it. The captured coin will be collected in the coin back present at the right-side of the gameplay board. The movement of the coin is limited by the diagonal lines that are appearing on the board. The game will show you the moves that are valid. There is a five minutes timer that runs along the game. The timer starts a countdown once the game begins. The time is paused as soon as the player has played his move, until the opponent makes his move. If the timer reads 00:00 before the player has finished the game then the opponent automatically wins.</p>
